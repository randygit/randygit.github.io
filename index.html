              <p>In 2012, the Commission on Overseas Filipinos estimated that approximately 10.5 million Filipinos worked or resided abroad.[1] This is about eleven percent of the population figure of 94.01 estimated by the National Statistics Office.</p>
              <p>More than a million Filipinos every year leave to work abroad through overseas employment agencies, and other programs, including government-sponsored initiatives. Overseas Filipinos often work as doctors, physical therapists, nurses, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, architects,entertainers, technicians, teachers, military servicemen, seafarers, students and fast food workers.[citation needed] Also, many overseas workers are women applying as domestic helpers and caregivers.Others emigrate and become permanent residents of other countries.</p>
              <p>The exodus includes a number of skilled workers taking on unskilled work overseas, resulting in what has been referred to as a brain drain, affecting the health and education sectors. For example, doctors have retrained to become nurses </p>            
              <blockquote> 
                <p>As the Philippines among other countries who train and export labor repeatedly has faced failures in protecting labor rights the deskilling of labor has increased on a global scale. A strong worldwide demand for healthcare workers causes many Filipino people to emigrate without ever getting hired or become deskilling while possibly raising their salary. The result is a no-win situation for the sending and receiving country. The receiving countries lose as skilled workers are not fully utilizing their skills while the home country simultaneously experience a shortage of workers in emigrating prone sectors.</p>

              <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2013 by <a href="#">Randy</a></p>            
              <p>Poverty incidence is the the proportion of families/individuals with per capita income/expenditure less than the per capita poverty threshold to the total number of families/individuals. </p>
              <p>From PSA's 2012 survey, Metro Manila has a poverty incidence of only 2.6 percent, or  only 76,530 families.   The “less poor” regions (those with less than 20 percent poverty) are in Ilocos, CAR, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon and Calabarzon. The rest of the regions and their component provinces have poverty incidence of over 25 percent. </p>            
              <blockquote> 
                <p>The decline in poverty has been slow and uneven, much slower than neighboring countries who experienced broadly similar numbers in the 1980s,[4] such as People's Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, Indonesia (where the poverty level lies at 8.5%) or Vietnam (13.5%). This shows that the incidence of poverty has remained significantly high as compared to other countries for almost a decade. The unevenness of the decline has been attributed to a large range of income brackets across regions and sectors, and unmanaged population growth. The Philippines poverty rate is roughly the same level as Haiti.</p>

              <p>The poverty threshold is the minimum level of income needed to meet the basic food needs and non-food requirements. In 2012, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, a family of five needs at least P5,450 on the average every month to meet the family’s basic food needs, and at least P8,022 every month to meet the food and non-food thresholds. </p>         
              <blockquote>
                <p>Per PSA's definition</p>
                <p>
                  Basic food requirements are currently based on 100% adequacy for the Recommended Energy and Nutrient Intake (RENI) for protein and energy equivalent to an average of 2000 kilocalories per capita, and 80% adequacy for other nutrients. 
                  |
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, basic non-food requirements, indirectly estimated by obtaining the ratio of food to total basic expenditures from a reference group of families, cover expenditure on: 1) clothing and footwear; 2) housing; 3) fuel, light, water; 4) maintenance and minor repairs; 5) rental of occupied dwelling units; 6) medical care; 7) education; 8) transportation and communication; 9) non-durable furnishings; 10) household operations; and 11) personal care & effects.</p>
